# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to {{ project name here }} documentation! Your help is greatly appreciated.

---
**!! IMPORTANT !!**

First consider if the contribution you're wanting to make is either:
1. a high-level spec for how multiple services/repositories interact with one another

or

2. a technical specification for one of the services

If your're making 1. a high-level spec, then you're at the right place! [Proceed to How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute) and you'll be on your way! If you're instead working on 2. 
a technical specification for one of the services. Head over to that repository's CONTRIBUTE.md and go from there.
